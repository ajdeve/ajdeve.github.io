“The Market of Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism,” by George Akerlof
Consumers face incomplete​ information on used cars. The imbalanced information between sellers and buyers give more power to sellers manipulating the prices and giving buyers uncomfortable buying position.</description></item><item><title>Data Collection</title><link>https://ajdeve.github.io/docs/project2/datacollection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 08:48:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajdeve.github.io/docs/project2/datacollection/</guid><description>Dataset # Our dataset is taken from Kaggle public dataset (1.45 GB)​. Based on resale car listings on Craigslist​, columns include selling price, car attributes, color, condition, VIN, mileage, make and model, etc.​ We enhanced and imputed some data with data from iSeeCars.
Used Car Dataset
MSRP Dataset

👉 Since each listing data is 100% based on seller entry on Craiglist, there is high possibility sellers tend to input false data, resulting in datapoints that are anormal.</description></item><item><title>EDA</title><link>https://ajdeve.github.io/docs/project2/eda/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 08:48:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajdeve.github.io/docs/project2/eda/</guid><description>Explorative Data Analysis # Perforing EDA, we found a couple of interesting insights.
Price against key features Price against several key variables:​ # There seems to be a significant difference of price ranges between car manufacturers. However the range within each manufacturer seems very large. It is most possibly due to high number of different car models. That&amp;rsquo;s why we will not include manufacturer and model as predictors as they can be better represented by other more relevant variables.</description></item><item><title>Pre-modelling</title><link>https://ajdeve.github.io/docs/project2/pre-modelling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 08:48:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajdeve.github.io/docs/project2/pre-modelling/</guid><description>Pre-modelling # Initial Outlier handling &amp;amp; filling in null values​ # Odometer: ​ # Highly right skewed ​ Outliers are removed: Upper threshold +7* stdev​ Condition: # Fill nulls based on odometer​ Newer condition has low odometer.

Contextual Anomaly Detection # Odometer: ​ # Standard car odometer should have max 300,000 miles.​ Trimming data with 75th quantile + 3*IQR, ~268,000, as a cut reduced skewness from 3.04 to 0.3​. Only new car should have 0 odometer so trimmed otherwise​.

We pick our models base on two considerations, flexibility (accuracy) and interpretability.​ We value model accuracy over interpretability because:​ The industry we are in doesn’t require we provide explanation for the decision we make.​ Features of our used car dataset are easy to understand, thus making it easy for us to debug the model even without high model interpretability.</description></item><item><title>Result</title><link>https://ajdeve.github.io/docs/project2/result/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 08:48:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajdeve.github.io/docs/project2/result/</guid><description>Model Results # Just like our expectation, Ensemble Tree methods, specifically XGBoost has the best overall performance. ​ This is not very surprising since ensemble method is known to:​
Have higher predictive accuracy, compared to the individual models.​ Be very useful when there is both linear and non-linear type of data in the dataset​ Linear Regression and Linear SVR, like expected, didn’t perform well. From the R squared score, we see that both models could not capture all the variance of our data.</description></item></channel></rss>
